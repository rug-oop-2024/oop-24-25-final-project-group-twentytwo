# DSC-0005: Deepcopy returns for mutable attributes
# Date: 2024-11-10
# Decision: Return deepcopys of private attributes that are mutable (lists, dicts, np.arrays etc..)
# Motivation: Maintain encapsulation and prevent direct external modification of important attributes.
# Reason:
- Using deepcopy return for muttable objects ensures that the object can't be altered, preventing leakage. 
# Limitations:
- Storage: returning deepcopys can be quite heavy on storage, especially when large attributes are returned. This can cause a limitation on performance.
# Alternatives:
- Shallow Copy: a shallow copy is less expensive, but it can cause leakage of mutable objects.
