# DSC-002: Encapsulation and Use of Private Variables in `detect_feature_types`
# Date: 2024-11-10
# Decision: Use private variables `_feature_list` and `_data` within the `detect_feature_types` function.
# Status: Accepted
# Motivation: Enhance encapsulation and clarity in the implementation.
# Reason: 
- `_feature_list` is declared as a private variable, because it should not be changed manually.
- `_data` is declared as a private variable to isolate the dataset read operation.
- Private variables reduce the risk of accidental modification of intermediate states and enhance code clarity by signaling that these are not part of the function's public API.
# Limitations: 
- The private convention (`_variable_name`) in Python is not enforced, relying instead on adherence.
- There is no explicit validation or handling of unexpected changes to the dataset structure (e.g., column types).
# Alternatives: 
- Use public variable names for `_feature_list` and `_data`, increasing the risk of accidental modification.
```
