# DSC-009: Metric Weights Configuration
# Date**: 2024-11-10  
# Decision: Allow users to configure metric weights for model evaluation  
# Status: Accepted  
# Motivation:  
When multiple evaluation metrics are used, we allow the user to assign relative importance to each metric. This decision gives flexiblity to the user in deciding what metric is most important for their usage.
# Reason:  
- Custom evaluation: Giving users control over the weighting of metrics allows for more flexible model evaluation that suits the users needs.
# Limitations:  
- Single Metric Selection: If only one metric is selected, the system automatically assigns a weight of `1.0`, making it a non-configurable case.
#Alternatives:  
- No Metric Weights: Instead of allowing weights, each metric could be treated equally, and the final model evaluation could be a simple average of the selected metrics. However, this would limit the customization of the evaluation.
- Fixed Weighting Scheme: Predefined weights for each metric (e.g., 50% accuracy, 30% precision, 20% recall for classification tasks). This would remove flexibility though.
